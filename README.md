Easy to use Angular2 directives for files upload ([demo](http://valor-software.github.io/ng2-file-upload/)).
This package is Angular 14 compatible.

## Quick start

1. A recommended way to install ***ng2-file-upload-angular-14*** is through [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ralphinevanbraak/ng2-file-upload-angular-14) package manager using the following command:

  `npm i @ralphinevanbraak/ng2-file-upload-angular-14 --save`

2. Currently `@ralphinevanbraak/ng2-file-upload-angular-14` contains two directives: `ng2-file-select` and `ng2-file-drop`. `ng2-file-select` is used for 'file-input' field of form and
  `ng2-file-drop` is used for area that will be used for dropping of file or files.

  [demo](http://valor-software.github.io/ng2-file-upload/) and [demo sources](https://github.com/valor-software/ng2-file-upload/tree/master/demo).

## Using ***ng2-file-upload-angular-14*** in a project

1. Install as shown in the above section.

2. Import `FileUploadModule` into the module that declares the component using ***@ralphinevanbraak/ng2-file-upload-angular-14***:

```import { FileUploadModule } from '@ralphinevanbraak/ng2-file-upload-angular-14';```

3. Add it to `[imports]` under `@NgModule`:

```imports: [ ... FileUploadModule, ... ]```

4. Import `FileUploader` into the component:

```import {  FileUploader } from '@ralphinevanbraak/ng2-file-upload-angular-14';```

5. Create a variable for the API url:

```const URL = 'path_to_api';```

6. Initialize it:

```public uploader:FileUploader = new FileUploader({url: URL}); ```

## API for `ng2FileSelect`

### Properties

  - `uploader` - (`FileUploader`) - uploader object. See using in [demo](https://github.com/valor-software/ng2-file-upload/blob/master/demo/components/file-upload/simple-demo.ts)

### Events
 - `onFileSelected` - fires when files are selected and added to the uploader queue

## API for `ng2FileDrop`

### Properties

  - `uploader` - (`FileUploader`) - uploader object. See using in [demo](https://github.com/valor-software/ng2-file-upload/blob/master/demo/components/file-upload/simple-demo.ts)

  Parameters supported by this object:

  1. `url` - URL of File Uploader's route
  2. `authToken` - Auth token that will be applied as 'Authorization' header during file send.
  3. `disableMultipart` - If 'true', disable using a multipart form for file upload and instead stream the file. Some APIs (e.g. Amazon S3) may expect the file to be streamed rather than sent via a form. Defaults to false.
  4. `itemAlias` - item alias (form name redefinition)
  5. `formatDataFunction` - Function to modify the request body. 'DisableMultipart' must be 'true' for this function to be called.
  6. `formatDataFunctionIsAsync` - Informs if the function sent in 'formatDataFunction' is asynchronous. Defaults to false.
  7. `parametersBeforeFiles` - States if additional parameters should be appended before or after the file. Defaults to false.

### Events

  - `fileOver` - it fires during 'over' and 'out' events for Drop Area; returns `boolean`: `true` if file is over Drop Area, `false` in case of out.
  See using in [ts demo](https://github.com/valor-software/ng2-file-upload/blob/master/demo/components/file-upload/simple-demo.ts) and
  [html demo](https://github.com/valor-software/ng2-file-upload/blob/master/demo/components/file-upload/simple-demo.html)
  - `onFileDrop` - it fires after a file has been dropped on a Drop Area; you can pass in `$event` to get the list of files that were dropped. i.e. `(onFileDrop)="dropped($event)"`
